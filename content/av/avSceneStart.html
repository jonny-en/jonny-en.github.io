        The general topic of our research is to acquire <span class="highlight">sensor data </span>and act according to its interpretation. This leads to a <span class="highlight">closed loop of sensing and acting</span>. A typical application of this idea can be found in <span class="highlight">autonomous robots</span> that interpret their environment, choose from alternative strategies to solve their task, and then move the robot or its grippers. Such devices can be used in autonomous transportation or to perform service tasks.
