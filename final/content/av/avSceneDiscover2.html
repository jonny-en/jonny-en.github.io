            Have you ever wondered why cameras are able to <span class="highlight">recognise objects</span> such as cars, people and faces?</span>
            <br>Like always there are a lot of different ways to get what you want, but in the case of object recognition every one of them starts with a very important step: <span class="highlight">The preprocessing.</span>
            <br> The preprocessing itself can involve a high number of single steps or filters, which are optimizing the incoming picture of the camera for future calculations.
            <br>
            <br>In this example, <span class="highlight"> Lisa's camera </span>is able to show some of these filters. You can choose and combine them on the right side of the page, to separate the obects.
            <br>
            <span class="highlight">NOTICE:</span> The outcoming result highly depends on the order in which the filters are chosen.
