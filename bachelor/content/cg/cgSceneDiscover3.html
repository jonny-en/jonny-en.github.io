    <div class="info">
    Now everything is set to motion, but in contrast to this example <span class="highlight">with animation
    often comes physics</span>! In our courses we are teaching how animated objects can interact (e.g. collide)
    and how the maths behind it works. At a very last step, you can <span class="highlight">change the speed</span> of the animated spheres.<br>
    <br>We hope this little demo was able to show you what our work at the university is about.
