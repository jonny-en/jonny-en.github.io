	<div class="info">Since July 2002 the <span class="highlight">Computer Graphics Research Group</span> is led by <span class="highlight">Prof. Dr. Stefan MÃ¼ller</span>. The focus of the group is 3D image synthesis in interactive, immersive, and augmented environments using modern commodity graphics hardware. Thereby, the whole workflow is represented: modeling, interaction, simulation, and rendering. The <span class="highlight">rendering of complex data under real time conditions</span> , new techniques for increased realism and quality (esp. in combination with lighting simulations),<span class="highlight"> real time capable ray tracing</span> of both triangular and parametrical objects, as well as using programmable graphics hardware in the medical context are the main contributions of this group. For <span class="highlight">virtual and augmented reality applications</span> the working group has a <span class="highlight">mixed-reality-lab</span> with different input and output devices at their disposal. In addition, several workstations with state-of-the-art hardware and software on different platforms are provided.
