        <span class="highlight">3D models</span> are defined through geometric ratios between points, lines and areas.
        <br> Building these models is a part of both, our courses at the university and our work in the group. Of course they can be extremely complex, but in this example it's just a simple sphere.
        <br>
        <span class="highlight">Try playing with the parameters</span> to change the size and the number of segments used displaying the sphere.
